1. The main function is in the Kisei.java

2. In default, if you run the program directly, it will create a game with 12 board size, target 6 and print the game id. Then it will make first move and wait 6 seconds for opponent to put chess. In the following steps, I will always give 6 seconds for opponent to put chess

3. If you want change the board size and the target, you can change value of the variables: boardSize and target, in the start() method.

4. If you want change the wait time, you can change the global variable waitTime

5. If you want to accept game created by other team, you should change the value of the variable createGameOrAcceptGame to 2 in start() method, and you also need provide the game id, change the value of variable acceptedGameId to target team id. 
IMPORTANT: If the program accepted a game, it need the opponent put his chess first or it will keep waiting

6. You can also change the search depth by change the global variable searchDeep.

If you encounter any problems while running the program, you can contact me at anytime. I am willing help you to fix the problems. My email: hujinhao@gwu.edu
